    • Analyze behaviour and performance of active components. Construct circuits, run simulations and tests to confirm behavior of diodes, bjt’s, and mosfets <br> <br>
    • Began process by using an industry grade SPA machine to obtain and study I-V characteristics and parameters for the active components, then analyzed the given circuits <br>

    • Constructed many rectifier circuits to futher study diodes. Designed collector and emitter bjt amplifiers inorder to analyze small and large signal characteristics, further supported our findings with LT spice simulations<br><br>
    • Designed different configurations on CS NMOS amplifier with and without capacitors to acquire and compute small signal characteristics for MOSFETS, further analysis found Q point, frequency response, and voltage gain<br>

    • Simulated FEA through solidworks identifying failure conditions and frame fatigue strength under stress conditions<br>
    • Conducted root cause analysis on frames to evaluate faults and their feasibility <br>
    • Proposed changes to frame and conducted truss beam calculations <br>

    • The design fulfilled its purpose with the ability to shoot a ball in the range of 15m - 20m<br>
    • Motor power was limited for testing purposes but could be increased to acheive more distance <br>
